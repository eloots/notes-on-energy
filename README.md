## An opinion on Small Modular Nuclear Reactors

[An article](https://illuminem.com/energyvoices/c1f245f8-d201-498e-9e85-8592095ae2ac) by Michael Barnard.

## The realities of 70 years of nuclear development in the UK

The UK is doing a decommissioning of the infrastructure and cleanup of the [Sellafield nuclear site](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sellafield). It is expected that this will be completed in 2120 (we're 2022, so that in about one hundred years) at an estimated cost of £121 billion.

## Background on why PWR won against MSR

Even though a Molten Salt Nuclear (MSR) reactor was successfully tested at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in the fifties/sixties, Pressurised Water Nuclear Reactors (PWR) became the reactor type of choice. [This talk](https://youtu.be/bbyr7jZOllI) explains how this happened.
